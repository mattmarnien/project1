# sharkFin

sharkFin is a website application that allows the user to search and track stocks based on their company name! The user can then add the specific stock and choose the amount of shares to add to their portfolio. The portfolio will then total up the value of your stock with the amount of shares of each stock and then add those up for a total value of portfolio. Percentage is also provided compared to starting fund. 

## Features

## Installation

Installation not needed.

## Roadmap

We want to enable a cryptocurrency page for the application that allows you to add crypto to portfolio and play with that as well. 
The current free API limits the app's ability to update asset prices on a sufficiently frequent basis, and I am explorting options to deal with this.
